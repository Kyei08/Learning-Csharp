Key improvements and explanations:

Clear Examples: The code provides a variety of function examples, from simple void functions to functions with return values, optional parameters, named parameters, and tuple returns.
void Functions: Demonstrates functions that perform actions but don't return values.
Functions with Return Values: Shows how to create functions that calculate and return results.
Functions with Parameters: Illustrates how to pass arguments to functions.
Optional Parameters: Explains how to define optional parameters with default values.
Named Parameters: Shows how to call functions using named parameters for better readability.
Tuple Returns: Demonstrates how to return multiple values from a function using tuples, and how to deconstruct those tuples.
String Interpolation: Uses string interpolation ($"{variable}") for cleaner and more readable output.
Comments: Includes comprehensive comments to explain each part of the code.
Main() Method: Shows how to call the functions from the Main() method.
Deconstruction: shows how to deconstruct tuples both when declaring the variables, and inline.
Example outputs: The console outputs from the examples are now more clearly formatted.
